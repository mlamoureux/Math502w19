    "\n",
    "To use the point contact in the problem, we will have to work with the Dirac delta \"function\" which is also known as a distribution. You can read about distributions in Howison.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is simple. When you have a vector space, you can talk about the linear functionals on it. For instance, in linear algebra we work with the n-dimensional vector space ${\\mathbb R}^n$. A linear functional is a real-valued linear function $L:{\\mathbb R}^n \\rightarrow {\\mathbb R}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear means $L(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y}) = L(\\mathbf{x}) + L(\\mathbf{y})$ for all vectors $\\mathbf{x,y}$ and $L(\\lambda \\mathbf{x}) = \\lambda L(\\mathbf{x})$ for all scalars $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an interesting fact in linear algebra that every linear functional $L$ on ${\\mathbb R}^n$ can be represented as a dot product with some fixed vector $\\mathbf z$ (that depends on $L$). So we write:\n",
    "$$L_{\\mathbf z} (\\mathbf{x}) = {\\mathbf z}\\cdot \\mathbf{x} = \\sum_i z_i x_i.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, instead of the vector space ${\\mathbb R}^n$ think of the vector space of continuous, smooth functions on the line. We write this as $C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$, where $\\infty$ means we have infinity many derivatives for any function in this set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a linear functional on this space, we can just fix any continuous function $g$ with compact support, and define the function $L_g$ by the formula\n",
    "$$L_g (f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)g(x) \\, dx. \\qquad \\mbox{ (This is also an inner product!) }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily check that this is a linear function, and real-valued, so it is a linear functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how about this functional:\n",
    "$$L(f) = f(0).$$\n",
    "Easy to check that this is a linear function, and real-valued, so it is a linear functional. Can we find a function like $g$ that works in the inner product? Well, sort of. We define a **generalized** function $\\delta$, called the Dirac delta function, that has the form\n",

    "anbd we \"normalize it so that the mass under the infinity is exactly one: $\\int_{-\\epsilon}^\\epsilon \\delta(x) dx = 1.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so that's a nutty function, but it is an example of a distribution. This is a well-developed area of mathematics, thanks to Laurent Schwartz, so although it looks weird at first, it works. Since $\\delta$ is zero everywhere except the origin, we can write $f(x) \\delta(x) = f(0)\\delta(x)$ and so\n",
    "$$\\int f(x)\\delta(x) dx = \\int f(0)\\delta(x) dx = f(0) \\int \\delta(x) dx = f(0)\\cdot 1 = f(0).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The point is, the linear functions $L_\\delta$ is well defined, by the formula $L_\\delta(f) = f(0)$, even though\n",
    "the function $\\delta$ is kind of mysterious. Think of it as just being a symbolic representation for certain linear functionals. "
