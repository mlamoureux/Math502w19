Newton's universal gravitation constant $G$ also enters into the problem -- you can look up what units it is measured in, on Google. Or you can figure it out yourself from the force formula for planetary attraction $$\\mbox{ Force } = G \\frac{Mm}{R^2}$$\n",

    "Nuclear bombs, when exploded in the atmosphere, produce a large fireball that expands in the approximate shape of a sphere of some radius $r = r(t)$, which is a function of elapsed time.
